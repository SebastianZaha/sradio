== Synopsis ==

  Small program for playing online radio streams. It fetches information on 
 the current song and current show from the radio's webpage and displays
 them in a tooltip.

== Install ==

  As playback is done with gstreamer, and it depends on various plugin packs,
 gem packaging would be pointless. 

  Dependencies: ruby, ruby-gnome2, libgstreamer0.10-ruby1.8, libjson-ruby, 
    gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3, gstreamer0.10-gnomevfs, gstreamer0.10-alsa, 
    gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad

  I know, I know.. that's a lot of dependencies. But if you don't already have
 them installed, that's because you don't use many ruby/gnome/gstreamer apps.
 And that's a damn shame, cause ruby, gnome and gstreamer are all wicked kewl.
 (json too)


  Options:

  1. Install from the source package
     - get the gzip from here: http://sebi.tla.ro/files/devel/
     - unpack, enter directory and run 'rake install'

  2. Install distribution package from repository.
     - add repository url [1]:
        deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/grimdonkey/ubuntu hardy main
        deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/grimdonkey/ubuntu hardy main
     - run 'apt-get install sradio'

== License ==

  All code licenced BSD.

  The installer rakefile and tasks taken from the alexandria project. MIT licensed.

  The 3 icons used are shamelessly stolen from the 'dropline-neu' and 
'nuoveXT' gnome icon packs.



== Extending ==

  Information on supported radios is stored in separately packaged json files.
 
  If you'd like to hear a specific other station, mail me the details and I 
 will happily add it to the package.

  If you're the 'do-it-yourself' kind of guy, please check radio.json.sample 
 for details on creating the config files. If you think you need aditional
 config options for parsing, please mail me the details, and i'll update 
 accordingly.
  
  If you think the code sucks and you want to fix it, I'll happily accept 
 suggestions / patches.

  If you... err.. you get the idea.. whatever you need.. mail me.
